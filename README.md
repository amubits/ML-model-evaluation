## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for a comprehensive study on machine learning model evaluation, focusing on decision trees and classification metrics. The project aims to explore the effectiveness of various machine learning models in classifying data, with an emphasis on understanding model performance through confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure metrics.

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset that includes features relevant to the classification task at hand. While specific details of the dataset are not provided in the document content, it is typically composed of multiple features used to predict a target variable. 
Users interested in replicating the study or applying the evaluation techniques to their own models should consider the following:
Data Characteristics: Understanding the number of features, distribution of data, and the type of target variable (binary/multi-class) is crucial.
Preprocessing Steps: Any preprocessing steps such as normalization, handling missing values, or feature engineering that were applied to the dataset before model training.
Availability: Information on how to access or generate a similar dataset for testing purposes.
